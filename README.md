The entire dataset is contained in a single CSV file named __Car Sales.xlsx - car_data.csv__ in the __Dataset__ directory

## Python Code
No data cleaning or pre-processing was required so no python code has been added to the repository

## Power Bi files 
The Power Bi project files are contained inside the __PowerBi__ directory. Each student's project is in a separate folder.
